Project Description
Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js with Express

Frontend: React

Database: PostgreSQL

🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to periodically fetch data from configurable remote sources (URLs), parse them using predefined regular expressions (for IPs, domains, hashes, and URLs), and persist the extracted indicators in a PostgreSQL database. These indicators will then be published to public directories as .txt files.

🔍 Data Fetching & Processing
The admin can define data sources dynamically via a management UI.

Each source entry will have:

Source URL

Indicator Type (IP / Domain / Hash / URL)

Fetch Interval (in seconds)

Active / Passive status

The backend will:

Fetch data from each source at defined intervals.

Parse data using regex (IP, domain, hash, URL).

Save indicators into the database.

Maintain metadata for each record:

Creation time

Last update time (update timestamp if duplicate is re-fetched)

Source URL

Type of hash (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512)

Active/passive status

🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Authentication Types:

Local authentication

LDAP (Active Directory) authentication

Initial Admin User:

Username: admin

Password: test123 (stored encrypted with bcrypt)

User Roles:

Admin: Full access, can delete/update indicators, manage settings, view logs.

User: Can toggle active/passive status and add notes (analyst role).

Reporter: Read-only access to indicators.

📁 Indicator Management
Create a UI for manual addition of IPs, domains, hashes, and URLs.

Display all automatically fetched indicators in a table view with:

Active/passive toggle

Editable notes field

📝 Logging & Audit
Every action in the system will be logged (CRUD operations, status changes, etc.)

Admins can view logs via a web-based Audit Logs page.

📂 Public Directory & Blacklist Generation
Expose a public directory: /public/blacklist

Export active indicators into .txt files as follows:

Paths:

blacklist/IP/BlackIP0.txt, BlackIP1.txt, ...

blacklist/Domain/BlackDomain0.txt, ...

blacklist/Hash/BlackHash0.txt, ...

blacklist/URL/BlackURL0.txt, ...

Each file should contain maximum 100,000 lines

Domain entries should be exported as both domain.com and *.domain.com if applicable.

⚙️ Settings Page (Admin Only)
Admins will have access to a Settings page to:

Configure LDAP / Active Directory connection

Manage fetch intervals and source types for each data source (start/stop functionality)

Update sensitive configuration values (passwords must be encrypted)

✅ Whitelist Management
A separate Whitelist page will allow input of IPs, domains, hashes that should not be blacklisted

Attempted additions to the blacklist from whitelisted entries should be logged with:

Source

Timestamp

Attempt details
